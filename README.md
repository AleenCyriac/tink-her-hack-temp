### Project Description
RBooK is a dual-purpose web platform designed to modernize the cooking experience. It functions as both a social recipe repository where users can document and share their own culinary creations, and an AI-powered kitchen assistant. By leveraging the Gemini 1.5 Flash API, the platform provides users with an interactive "Sous-Chef" that can generate recipes on the fly, suggest substitutions, and provide nutritional guidance.

### The Problem statement
Standard recipe websites are static. If a user wants to substitute an ingredient (e.g., "I don't have eggs, what can I use?") or adjust a recipe for a specific diet, they have to leave the site and search elsewhere. There is no centralized platform that combines community-driven content (user-added recipes) with real-time intelligent assistance.

### The Solution
Our platform turns the traditional recipe website into a personal kitchen assistant. By combining a community-driven collection with a smart chatbot, we allow users to share their own recipes and get instant, tailored cooking help. Instead of scrolling through endless search results, you can simply chat with the site to find meals based on what is in your fridge or get quick ideas for dietary swaps. It simplifies meal planning and reduces food waste by turning a basic search into an easy, helpful conversation, making cooking simple for everyone.
